# MultiProcess
Testing multiprocessing queues into the XMLparser FileScan library

XMLparser converts a file from XML format into a CSV format.  Given a file directory, XMLparser will recursively scan subdirectories.  It will execute the conversion on files with .xml extension.  The converted-to-CSV output will be written to user desktop.
